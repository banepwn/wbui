**The default theme is designed to resemble the Windows Classic theme.** Given how simple the theme is and the fact respected projects such as [Wine](https://i.imgur.com/PHNGyHO.png) and [ReactOS](https://reactos.org/sites/default/files/linter.png) comfortably reimplement the same theme and claim legality, I don't think this is a problem. If you disagree, consider making a fork or pull request to change it.
